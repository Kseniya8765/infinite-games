              <h4>Withdrawing your consent</h4>
              <p>
                If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
                information, which may be express and/or implied consent
                depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any
                time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in
                the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of
                the processing before its withdrawal, nor when applicable law
                allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
                information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
                other than consent.

                You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional
                communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link
                in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the
                details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT
                THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed fromthe marketing
                lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example,
                to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
                administration and use of your account, to respond to service
                requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

              <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
